# Developing and Securing RESTful APIs with Spring Boot
This sample application shows how to develop a Restful api with
SpringBoot and secure it using Spring Security via JSON Web Tokens.

I will try to follow one by one all the steps of this [guide](https://auth0.com/blog/implementing-jwt-authentication-on-spring-boot/).
 Each step will become in one commit of the project for make an easy way to move rewind/forward inside the project.
# How To Setup The Application And Run It
* Make sure you have Java 10 installed on your system. [Get it here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk10-downloads-4416644.html)
* Clone the repository using the command `git clone https://github.com/vladimirfomene/springboot-auth-updated.git`
* Run. I've used [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) as IDE. I've configured it to run Gradle from de IDE.
* I've used [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) as testing Restful API application.
